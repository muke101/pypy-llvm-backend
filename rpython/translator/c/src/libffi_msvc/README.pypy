This directory contains the libffi package, copied from the 
Modules/_ctypes/libffi_msvc directory of the CPython distribution,
as of relase 2.6a3.

It was slightly modify to suit pypy needs:
- Py_FatalError was renamed to libffi_fatalerror, in ffi.c
- The file pypy_ffi.c was added, to resolve undefined externals.
  Its contents is inspired from the `ctypes.c` file of the CPython module.
